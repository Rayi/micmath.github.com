Welcome the newest JSDoc project, _JSDoc 3_. As you can see I've decided to make a few changes.

Version 1 and 2 relied exlusively on mailing lists to communicate with users. Generally I find mailing lists to be a clunky method of communicating: as impersonal as a message board but also as choresome as email. I personally subscribe to about a dozen and I'm constantly having to clear them from my inbox.

I haven't decided if version 3 will eventually have a mailing list. There are three core functions that a project mailing list should fulfill:

- Announcements: notify users when new releases or other updates are made available.
- Community: keep users up to date on what's going on within the project, what decisions are being considered, what work is planned, and insight into the reasons behind those plans.
- Support: provide a forum for users to ask questions and maintain a record of the answers.

Let's consider those. First announcements. There is now a much better medium for short, frequent announcements that users can opt into if they are interested: Twitter. In Version 3 all project announcements will be tweeted via [@jsdoc3](http://twitter.com/jsdoc3). If you are interested in staying up to date, follow the project.

Secondly, community. I think the mailing list has really failed in this area in previous versions. I've witnessed much more interesting communities develop around blogs however. And that's where this page comes in. If you're interested in posts about _why_ things are (or aren't) happening, or if you're just interested in what I think is notable on topics related to Rhino, JavaScript, and random things related to JSDoc, subscribe to this blog.

Finally we have support. Again I think the mailing list has been less than adequate for this. It's fine if you want to send an email about a problem, and I want to send a reply. But I'd call that email. Including 130 other people on those comminiques seems a little spammy. Instead I'm going to maintain a simple email address. If there are frequent questions I'll post the answer to the project wiki, perhaps on a FAQ. I admit, this is the one function I think might be difficult to maintain, so if anyone knows a better free/oss solution, please let me know.
